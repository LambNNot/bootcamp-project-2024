      <p>Hello World! This is my website.</p>
      <p>
        The Natural Deities of Magnolia are manifests of the people’s creative
        lifeforce, their <em>Viessence</em>. Little does the common-man know
        that although the Gods establish rule of their own will, they are
        granted their strengths by those of their worshippers. It was once
        believed that the death of a natural deity was no more than the
        cessation of their worship. What Magnolian residents aptly call
        <em>Will</em>, the elemental magic of their day-to-day lives, is not
        solely bestowed upon them by some higher power but rather a realization
        of their own attunement with the different elements of nature.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, the folk tales of the Magnolian world will teach that these
        powers are gifts of the Gods of Nature and that one’s mastery over Will
        is tied to their faith. It is for this reason that those who have yet
        exercised or are ungifted with Will are called <strong>Acredo</strong>,
        meaning <em>"without faith"</em>.
